      <url type="details">https://github.com/TibixDev/winboat/releases/tag/v0.9.0</url>
      <description>
        <p>Features:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Podman is now supported, you can pick it during installation, however USB passthrough on Podman is not supported yet</li>
          <li>UWP app support has been added, now you can see and start all your UWP apps</li>
          <li>A Custom App can now be created from an existing one if you'd like to modify it</li>
          <li>Apps can now be filtered</li>
          <li>Apps can now be launched via the context menu</li>
          <li>You can now adjust the Application Scaling in Configuration</li>
          <li>New WinBoat installations will now reserve the port range 47270  - 47370 on Docker for all used services, this is to avoid common ports and port conflicts in the future. In the meantime Podman does not support port ranges in compose files, so we're allocating random ports</li>
          <li>You can now add new or replace any existing FreeRDP arguments in Configuration</li>
          <li>A wm-class prefix has been added for folks who wanna style WinBoat FreeRDP windows in their WM</li>
          <li>Windows will now auto-synchronize the clock on new installations</li>
          <li>The default install path has been set to ~/winboat, of course you can still change it to whatever you prefer</li>
          <li>You can now disable animations within WinBoat if you're sensitive to motion or your compositor doesn't play nicely with Electron</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Fixes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>If you're using a Custom ISO for installation, that ISO will get auto-unmounted afterwards so the next time you start WinBoat with that ISO deleted, it will work properly</li>
          <li>Fixed the CPU usage spiking when RDP monitoring is enabled</li>
          <li>Corrected a few typos</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Misc:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>dockur/windows version upgraded to 5.14</li>
          <li>All WinBoat ports are now bound by default to 127.0.0.1</li>
          <li>Improved the security of the Guest Server (thanks @mrsheepsheep and @matt0x00)</li>
        </ul>
